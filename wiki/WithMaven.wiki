#How to build the Weather Wizard with Maven

= With Maven =
==Pre-requisites==
  * You need an [http://www.sliksvn.com/en/download SVN (Subversion) client] to download the artifacts of this project. The executable *must* be in the path.
  * You need a [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html Java Development Kit] (JDK)
  * You need [http://maven.apache.org/download.html Maven]
<br>
The SVN client mentioned above is used to download the artifact of _this_ project, as well as later by Ant, to download *_all_* the required dependencies.
<br>
<br>
To build all the required components, check out this project as mentioned on the [http://code.google.com/p/oliv-soft-project-builder/source/checkout source page], and below.
<br>
To do so, you obviously need an SVN client. I am personally using [http://www.sliksvn.com/en/download SlikSVN].
<br>
In a *_new directory_*, check out the code, and run the commands mentioned below.
<br>
<br>
To check out:
{{{
Prompt> svn checkout http://oliv-soft-project-builder.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ oliv.soft
Prompt> cd oliv.soft
}}}
<br>
_Note: *If you are behind a firewall*_
  You can setup the proxy you need for svn by modifying the file at {{{~/.subversion/servers}}}.
  You need to set it under the {{{[global]}}} section.
<br>
Now, there are 2 poms, one to download the required sub-projects, and another one to build everything.
<br>
{{{
mvn -f weather-wizard.co.pom.xml  initialize
mvn -f weather-wizard.pom.xml package
}}}
