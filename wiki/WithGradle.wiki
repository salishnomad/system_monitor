#summary Build with Gradle
#labels Featured

This is a two-step process.
You need to have Java and [http://gradle.org Gradle] installed on your system.


First you need to checkout the code of the current project, as mentioned [http://code.google.com/p/oliv-soft-project-builder/source/checkout here].

Then you need to checkout the code of the different projects to assemble, by running:

On Linux and MacOS
{{{
 Prompt> dos2unix checkout.bsh
 Prompt> chmod +x checkout.bsh
 Propmt> ./checkout.bsh
}}}
On Windows
{{{
 Prompt> checkout
}}}

Once the checkout process is completed, then you can type
{{{
 Prompt> gradle build
}}}
Note:
 The build accesses a Maven reporitory. If you are behind a firewall, modify the file named {{{ gradle.properties }}} available in each sub-directory. If you are not behind a firewall, comment the ant line in each {{{ build.gradle }}}, this one:
{{{
 ant.setproxy(proxyhost: "$proxyHost", proxyport: "$proxyPort")
}}}

You can also install the generated archives to Maven (locally) by typing
{{{
 Prompt> gradle install
}}}

It is also possible to test the build, by running
{{{
 Prompt> gradle WeatherWizard:run
}}}
and
{{{
 Prompt> gradle OlivSoftDesktop:run
}}}
Note:
 Those run are not 100% valid, as some configuration files are missing   in the runtime environment. Use the download section for that.
